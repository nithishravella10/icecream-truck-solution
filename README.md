## Introduction

**Problem:**  
  The ice cream company faces a recurring problem with product spoilage during the daily transportation of its goods using a distribution truck. The issue might be because of several reasons but the company wants to know the root cause to mitigate the spoilage.

**Solution:**  
Implemented a system that deploys sensors for monitoring indoor and outdoor conditions (leveraging open APIs). In case of unforeseen events, such as issues with ice cream storage, the system will generate alerts directed to the driver or manager. Concurrently, the system will enable real-time truck tracking and archive all sensor readings for in-depth analysis aimed at understanding the root cause and further analytical processes.

**Note:** Intermediate knowledge of AWS IoT, Raspberry Pi (RPi), sensors, and electronics is required for this project, as the details of each component are not covered in-depth.

## Installation and Usage

1. **Update Packages:**
   Once you complete the hardware setup and connect to the Raspberry Pi, update the packages using `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y` command to ensure they are at the latest version.

2. **Installing Required Libraries:**  
   - Install [smbus2](https://pypi.org/project/smbus2/) library for I2C communication. (`sudo pip install smbus2`)
   - Install [RPi.bme280](https://pypi.org/project/RPi.bme280/) library for interfacing Bosch BME280 digital sensor module. (`pip install RPi.bme280`)
   - After the above two steps, check with `i2cdetect -y 1` and observe whether you are returned with an address, mostly it is 76, if not modify the script accordingly.

3. **Wether API Setup:**  
   - You are required to create an account at [openweathermap.org](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up) to generate an API key.
   - Once you generate an API key, wait for some time to receive an activation mail.
   - Now make note of the API key, you are required to insert this in the script.

4. **AWS Account Setup:**
   - Make sure you have a working AWS account. If not, create a free-tier account.
   - Log in with a user account and select a region (use the same region consistently throughout the project; I used Sydney - ap-southeast-2). Ensure the chosen region has all AWS services available.

5. **Install AWS IoT Device SDK (Python):**  
   An essential step is to install the Python SDK on the Raspberry Pi and test if it is running correctly.
   - Go to `AWS IoT > Connect > Connect one device`
   - Complete the mentioned 5 steps to make sure that your device has SDK and can talk with AWS IoT Core. (Tip: use VNC for file transfer)
   - Provide appropriate permissions while creating the thing. This will conclude SDK installation and now you can observe a thing created in `AWS IoT > Manage > Things`.
   - The device name used in this project is "icecreamTruckDataLogger".
   - Once the SDK is set up, proceed to the next step, else troubleshoot.

6. **Create AWS IoT Rules & Resources:**
   - Create a standard table in DynamoDB, and use this in the lambda function to insert an item. (Partition key: `time_local` (String)) 
   - Rule for triggering the Lambda service (ruleForLambda):
      - Choose the AWS action as a Lambda function.
      - Provide a description and assign policies appropriately.
      - Message topic: "icecreamTruckDataLogger/truckData".
      - Basic ingest topic: "$aws/rules/ruleForLambda".
      - In the SQL statement, use `SELECT * FROM 'icecreamTruckDataLogger/truckData'`.
      - Create a Lambda function named "FunctionToStoreTruckData" with the runtime set to Python.
      - The code for the Lambda function is available in `lambdaFunRev1.py` file.
   - Rule for sending data to IoT Analytics services:
      - Follow similar steps as the previous one but choose the IoT Analytics action.
      - Create an IoT Analytics channel and IAM role for this.
   - Create an SNS topic (topicForTemperatureThd):
      - Create a topic and then a subscription in that topic, use email as the protocol, and verify the email to receive mail alerts.

7. **Clone and Run the Project:**
   Open the terminal, and move to a desired directory on your Raspberry Pi to clone this repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/nithishravella10/icecream-truck-solution`

     **Solution:** Check the SNS topic subscription and email verification process. Ensure the recipient's email is correctly verified.

## Issues and Features for Rev2
### Current Features
1. The Raspberry Pi executes the code line by line, taking inputs from the sensors and APIs. Once the inputs are ready, the data is sent to IoT Core in JSON format via the MQTT protocol.
2. When the temperature is normal (<30), the green LED glows. If the temperature is greater than 30, the red LED glows, indicating abnormal temperature.
3. After data is published to IoT Core, the data is sent to DynamoDB. If the data has abnormal values (temperature greater than 35), an email (SNS service) is delivered to the recipient, indicating abnormal temperature.
4. Similarly, a message is sent to IoT Analytics.

### Features for Rev2
1. Implementation of a feature to automatically start the Python script upon powering up the Raspberry Pi.
2. Implementation of a pre-conditioning feature for the sensors. (Research optimal threshold values for all operational sensors.)
3. Implementation of a slave device feature to gather data for the master (RPi). (integration of Zigbee/ Wifi/ Bluetooth protocols to enable short-range wireless communication between sensors and the main controller.
4. Implementation of a feature for logging errors to a text file with timestamps. Ensure the log includes the state data when the vehicle was started and its subsequent behavior.
5. Adding a logic to print in the terminal whether valid data has been received from the sensors or not.
6. Organize the DynamoDB table using a dynamic approach to efficiently store data in the database. Leverage the advantages of NoSQL to optimize data storage and retrieval processes.
7. Addressing the issue where the Lambda function is not invoked if GPS data is invalid. For example, in the current code, if a sensor fails to retrieve a value, it becomes stuck in an infinite loop and does not progress to the next line of code.
8. Performance improvements to enhance the response rate. Currently, it is 4-5 seconds.

## Conclusion
This Ice Cream Truck Solution project presents a foundational solution for monitoring transportation conditions. While the current features may not directly solve the ice cream truck problem, further calibration and the addition of other sensors in the upcoming Rev2 can potentially transform this project into a comprehensive solution offering real-time insights to address the root causes effectively.
